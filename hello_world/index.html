  <div id="demo" class="collapse">
    Traffic crawls, cell phone calls
    Talk radio screams at me
    Through my tinted window I see
    A little girl, rust red minivan
    She's got chocolate on her face
    Got little hands, and she waves at me
    Ya, she smiles at me
    Well hello world
    How you been
    Good to see you, my old friend
    Sometimes I feel, cold as steel
    Broken like I'm never gonna heal
    I see a light, little hope
    In a little girl
    Well hello world
    Every day I drive by
    A little white church
    It's got these little white crosses
    Like angels in the yard
    Maybe I should stop on in
    Say a prayer
    Maybe talk to God
    Like he is there
    Oh I know he is there
    Ya, I know he's there
    Well hello world
    How you been
    Good to see you, my old friend.
